        <p>
          I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to
          do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to
          dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like
          to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to
          smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank
          mind
